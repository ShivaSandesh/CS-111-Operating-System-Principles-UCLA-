Project 3A - CS 111 - Summer 2017 

Files in the submission:
1. lab3a.c : The fie contains the implementation of the required code for the
   	   1. superblock summary
	   2. group summary
	   3. free block entries
	   4. free I-node entries
	   5. I-node summary
	   6. directory entries
	   7. indirect block references
	   The code for the same have been divided into 5 smaller methods 
	   that each implements one or more of the above operations.
	   The most challenging part of this assignemnt was calculating the
	   offset that would be required to read the data from the appropriate 
	   block in the file image. 
2. Makefile : to build and run the deliverable program. The higher level targets are: 
   	      default ... compile program to produce an executable named lab3a
	      dist ... create the deliverable tarball
	      clean ... delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile
3. ext2_fs.h : A version of the Linux header file that defines the format of the EXT2 
   	     file system. It had all the key structs required for the project.
4. README : COntains exaplanation of all the files in the submission.
