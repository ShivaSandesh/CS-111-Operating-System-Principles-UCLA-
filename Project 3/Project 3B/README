HOW TO RUN THE CODE 
    if running directly the source file
    python lab3b.py NAME_OF_THE_INPUT_FILE
    eg:
    python lab3b.py trivial.csv

    if running using the script:
    ./s.sh NAME_OF_THE_INPUT_FILE

Files in the submission:
1. lab3b.py : The fie contains the implementation of the required code for the
   	    vaifying if the following summaries are correct or not.
   	   1. superblock summary
	   2. group summary
	   3. free block entries
	   4. free I-node entries
	   5. I-node summary
	   6. directory entries
	   7. indirect block references
	   The code for the same have been divided into smaller methods 
	   that each implements one or more of the above operations.
	   Determining the inconsistencies was a layered process one following
	   the other.
2. Makefile : to build and run the deliverable program. The higher level targets are: 
   	    default ... compile program to produce an executable named lab3b
	      dist ... create the deliverable tarball
	      clean ... delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile

3. README : COntains exaplanation of all the files in the submission.
4. s.sh:   Contians command to run the lab3b.py
