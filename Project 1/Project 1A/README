Number of hours spent 10-15 hours.
Files as the part of project :-
      1. laba1.c
      2. Makefile
      3. README

Major obstcales in the project.
      1. This project was consideraly harder than the last one and required
         extensive research. The research was basically to understand the usage
         of a particualr API along with the set of things that would go along
         with it. For example the pthread create() method required an additional
         method to be declared "worker" which will work on a particular thread.
         Although all of the infornmation was readily available in the Linux man
         page however, I did had to look up the examples of pollfd(3) online for
         better understanding. Those pages have been cited in ciations section.
      2. Another major obstacle devisng the testing methology for this project.

Files:
       1. lab1.c : The most confusing part of the lab was keeping knowing what
          events can cuase the program to exit successful as there are number of
          events that depnd upon one another. The polling()function was the
          hardest method to understand and use.
       2. Makefile: Makefile for this assignment was pretty straight forward as it
          did not required the check section as most of the checking could not
          be accoplished without actually running the commands.
