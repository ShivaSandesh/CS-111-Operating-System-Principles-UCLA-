Files in the submission:
         1. lab4c_tcp.c: Contains the implementaion of the code. It reads from
         the sensor and tcp server at the same time and process the both in 
         paalell. Supports the options  --id, --host and --log from the command
        line. Also it supports
        SCALE=F, SCALE=C, PERIOD=X, OFF, START and STOP while the program is
        running. It writes the output to the socket.
         1. lab4c_tls.c: The purpose of the code is same for both the cases.
           The only difference in this case is that this time the communication
           are over the secure network. All information is cryptographically
           encoded. Thus it is a safe environment relatively speaking.
2. Makefile: Contains targets and dependecies as required by the
        assignment descriptions.
                Targets include:
                default : To build program.
                check : To execute an automated smoke-test of the application
                to see if it runs and can talk to its sensors/actuators.
                clean: It deletes all programs and output generated by the
                Makefile.
                dist : Creates the deliverable tarball.
        3. README: File that contain description of all the other files.
